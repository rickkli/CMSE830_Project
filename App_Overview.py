### Overview  
Natural disasters can leave lasting impacts not only on communities and ecosystems, but also on the **economic stability and development** of countries.  
This project aims to **analyze and visualize the relationship between natural disasters and key economic indicators** from 2020 â€“ 2025.  

By integrating data from global disaster records and socioeconomic indicators, we seek to uncover:  
- How disaster frequency and severity correlate with changes in GDP, income, and employment.  
- Whether certain countries/regions show higher economic vulnerability to natural disasters.  
- How recovery patterns differ across countries and time periods.

The ultimate goal is to build **data-driven insights** that help policymakers, analysts, and researchers understand the 
            **economic resilience** of nations in the face of climate-related challenges.

1. **Integrate** natural disaster and economic indicator datasets to create a unified, analyzable framework.  
2. **Explore correlations** between disaster intensity/frequency and economic performance metrics.  
3. **Visualize patterns and trends** through interactive charts and geographic visualizations.  
4. **Identify vulnerable regions** that show strong economic declines following major disasters.  
5. **Support future predictive modeling** for estimating economic losses or resilience levels based on disaster characteristics.
